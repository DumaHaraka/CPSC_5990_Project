Disclosure, I am a 65, soon to be 66-year-old polio survivor. I began walking around 4 years old and have no use of my left arm. I was blessed to be able to get around and function in life. I still function but require an electric scooter to get around with a power seat lift in order to stand up. I also did get a handicap license plate as I hit my fifties because of a true need in order to avoid long distances as my legs began weakening further. When I was 19 years old back in 1975, I had completed a technical Programming degree at Control Data Institute. I applied at several places and had a very positive interview with a hospital records processing center in DeKalb County outside of Atlanta. The manager I interviewed with basically told me I had the position but he had to okay it with the Hospital. I followed up with my interviewer via phone, everything was good and I was excited about the opportunity. I followed up again and the tone had changed. He was very apologetic but the Hospital had told him that they needed to hire a black person and a black lady I went to school with fit the requirement along with checking another box, being female. I ended up finding a job as a Computer Operator at a Bank in Atlanta which delayed my entry into the Programming field for 3.5 years. I wasn't happy, however I refused to use my disabilities as a way to obtain the position because I felt it was wrong. I've never used it for advantage over another person. I believe that after my experience over 46 years ago, it is time to end affirmative action, enough Americans have been discriminated against and suffered for what they had nothing to do with using this racially discriminatory law. It is no more justifiable than if I had used my disability to wrest the Programming position from my former classmate or anyone. It would have made me no better than those who take positions from others based on race as opposed to merit. These types of advantages imposed against others are also an anchor around the neck of America as a whole. I watched our nation excel to the Moon and leave other nations in the dust.

This book will help you to structure and organise your individual language learning process, will give you the opportunity to independently determine the methodology of language learning, which will become interesting and unburdensome. In this amazing book everyone will find a lot of useful information: how to learn foreign languages, how to memorise information, how to deal with culture shock, what to pay attention to when travelling to another country. I am convinced that the book \"Polyglot Notes\" should be in the bag of every business person, school and college student, and tourist. The most important thing is that the book gives a good motivation. Don\\'t be afraid to do something to realise your dreams!

The BQ is a federal party, but runs no one outside the province, and cares nothing about the ROC or the vast, English-speaking majority in Canada. Most of the Anglos have been driven out, with Quebec French now mandatory for businesses and government. The PQ has always been Separatist, waxing and waning with the political Moon phases, but now with the Liberals headed for total annihilation, I expect they'll start beating those drums more fiercely.

And even today it is more dangerous, because they can do it perfectly with the information from the internet and with a simple follow-up of your activity in their online casinos. I have not fallen into addiction, luckily, but I have relatives who have, and it is very sad. I plan not to gamble again, but sometimes I go back just for fun, I have never used all my capital or my monthly earnings, but I have used small amounts that added up to important parts of my capital.\\r\\n\\r\\nI will give some advice: always look at your percentages used, not just the numbers, percentage of your capital that has resulted in profits, or losses. And another thing, if you win, withdraw immediately, especially if it is an online casino. Anyway, as many people say; the best way to win is not to play, remember that casinos are literally traps, otherwise, they would not exist. But if you do not see yourself capable of quitting, start reducing your risks, use the money on what you later regretted not using, when you can use it. Give gifts to your loved ones, or learn to invest in stocks and in the market. And set a loss limit, never break it (I know you will) but try as hard as possible not to do so, be loyal to yourself.

Global warming was officially stated at 1.1°C in 1991 and 1.06°C in 2022.  There is no mechanism that would allow greenhouse gas behavior to cause global warming.   The back of the United Nation's IPCC science report states it took its greenhouse gas samples at 20,000 meters altitude where it is common high school level knowledge there is no greenhouse radiant energy.  This is typical practice for deceptive marketing to state legal data transparency protecting the perpetrators from fraud prosecution.  \\n\\nEarth's greenhouse effect is frequently used as a primary example to high school students of a system always in saturation from the strong greenhouse gas water vapor absorbing all the greenhouse radiant energy from the earth with greenhouse gases within 20 meters of the surface that is all around us everyday and can't have its overall effect changed.  There is no further greenhouse radiant energy to interact with greenhouse gases.  At 1% average tropospheric water vapor over 99% of earth’s greenhouse effect is from water vapor.  Water vapor would hold earth's greenhouse effect in saturation if it were the only greenhouse gas in the atmosphere.\\n\\nArctic warming is taking place with the proving mechanism being warm Atlantic Ocean waters migrating deeper and more frequently into the Arctic Ocean warming it and the region.   That warmer water is causing a few weeks less of reflective snow and ice coverage resulting in more solar heat gain to the Arctic region surface.\\n\\nAtmospheric CO2 levels of 1200 ppm about three times what they are today would greatly invigorate C3 plants the majority of plant life on earth greatly greening the planet. \\n\\n0.4% of the atmosphere is CO2 and on average 1% is H20 water vapor.   (1% H20)/(0.4% CO2) = 25.  Water vapor is 25 times more present in the atmosphere on average than CO2.   Water vapor has an CO2e of 18,  18 X 25 = 450 CO2e total for water vapor to 1 CO2e for CO2. \\n\\nThe Earth’s oceans have 3-1/2 million sea floor volcanic vents warming the water and changing it’s chemistry that have not been systematically accounted for.\", \"at 49:20 chat's meme finally paid off, and I never saw a more glorious reaction than everyone realizing where they were\", '😎Hey, thanks for watching!

And it's like that with everything it touches. They create this illusion that healthcare somehow naturally an intrinsic 'right' and that it has always been this way but then along came capitalism (whatever that is, like maybe being allowed to keep what God provides, but that's a whole other subject) and suddenly it destroyed everything. But if you actually look at all of human history, healthcare has always been a service provided very personally and intimately by one person to another person, and always for a cost set by the provider! So let's just start there. Yes, in the history of Christianity the idea of providing medical care for free was highly revered, but it was VOLUNTARY, moreover, those few who were known for seriously practicing this were CANONIZED as saints(!!), not forced to do any such thing. The problem is many americans have not experienced the relative unpleasantness of healthcare in other countries compared to what we have. The brutal bedside manners (or lack thereof) of doctors, the complete disregard for human dignity, privacy, etc. These things are BUILT INTO those systems, and actually many of those countries' citizens think it's pretty normal and they may even be ok with it, but I would seriously caution americans to not assume that what they don't know about is actually what they want. If you're not someone who likes the idea of going to a hospital and being treated like a piece of meat or a herd of cows, just be cautious of their 'pretty' socialist ideas, is all i say.\", 'This Story really puts this Fire Storm into Perspective.

It seems you likely struggled in the first two coding rounds. Also, in my experience, a rejection notice wouldn\\'t take three weeks unless you were a strong contender. Two general points: The biggest issue arises when an over-prepared applicant (the \"competitive coder\" type) receives a straightforward question they recognize and immediately dives in without much communication. Whether they go down the wrong path or not is secondary. What matters most is seeing how a candidate tackles an unfamiliar problem; it\\'s not just about reaching the solution. Remember: The interviewer already knows the answer; they\\'re interested in your approach. Bonus: If you recognize an interview question (from practice, etc.), tell the interviewer immediately. Solving it instantly wastes their time, forcing them to ask another question with less time. Pretending you don\\'t know it won\\'t work; programmers are bad actors, and they\\'ll be even more frustrated. Most interviewers have backup questions prepared. As for the nodding and letting you make mistakes, that\\'s normal for a good interviewer. Interviewing is like walking a dog; you let them explore a bit, reeling them in when needed, but not holding them too tightly. Often, candidates explain their intended solution, and you know it\\'s wrong, but you let them proceed (unless they\\'ve misunderstood the problem) to see what happens. Interviewers find this hard because they must suppress their helpful instincts, which they use daily at work. Nods, smiles, and remarks like \"mmh, interesting\" or \"okay\" aren\\'t positive or negative signals; they\\'re just polite gestures. Don\\'t get overconfident; realize you\\'re on your own at that moment. The same applies to general conversation; the interviewer might ask probing questions but generally won\\'t add anything new, only helping you think or bounce ideas, like playing tennis with a wall. It\\'s mostly about letting you succeed or fail independently. Remember: The interviewer isn\\'t trying to help; they\\'re trying NOT to help. Corollary: If the interviewer gives a helpful tip, you\\'re likely behind schedule. A good interviewer will subtly insert the tip during conversation. But if they interrupt you entirely to give an obvious tip, you\\'re far off track and struggling with communication, as it\\'s probably not their first attempt to guide you.', \"@ 28:12 in pseudo code for depth first search, i think, it's neighbors= g[at] instead of neighbors= graph[at]\", 'We want hindi dub ❤🎉', 'That was funny!

The summary is basically, 'I didn't have the right answer right away.' This message can increase stress when taking these interviews. Simply stating 'think harder' doesn't offer useful guidance for preparation. As you mentioned initially, knowing how the failures contributed to future success would be helpful. For instance, did you increase your focus on algorithms? Did you refine your list of algorithms to memorize? Or did you concentrate more on big-O efficiency? The extra detail like 'Google just wants reasonable people' wasn't very helpful, given that you were presumably already reasonable in the first interview. On a positive note, you did mention that misinterpreting code is a critical error to avoid, which is an absolutely important point and it is very likely that coding interviewers will be specifically looking out for these kinds of misinterpretations of the problem.\", 'Thank you so much harry sir', 'That is why, I doubt Trump will ever agree to debate anyone on stage.', '-Snacksimus Prime • The Crimson Coward • Tactical Sloth • The Michelin Marksman • Camouflage Casserole • The Stationary Slaughterhouse • Red Ragnarok, Though Slower • Barrel-Chested, but Not With a Gun • The Bunker Bystander • Snack Norris • Paint Sponge Supreme • Weight Watcher Assassin • Cardio-Free Commando • Rolling Thunder, Minus the Rolling • The BBQ Ballistics Expert • The Snaccidental Shooter • Operation Dumbo Drop • Dead Weight Deadshot • Chubbs Rambo • Blubber Commando • The Tactical Tater Tot • Silent but Deadly (from the Snacks) • The Heavyset Hider • Friendly Fire Feaster • Big Red, Target Locked • Lieutenant Lard • Captain Chunk', 'Netenyahu masterminded the October 7, Pres Biden 😫😩👎👎', 'DOUBT!\\nat 6:27:49 why the setter function setSecret() is accepting a reference variable?

Thank you for this tutorial, and thank you Gwen for taking the time to create it! Edit: After watching the tutorial again, I have a couple of suggestions: 1. When making tutorials, you need to really understand the importance of adjusting your pace to that of the learner. You start with a great overview of key terms, then quickly introduce both advanced and beginner ideas together, which just confuses the viewer. Slow down, explain things simply, that\\'s what we need. 2. On the topic of mixing concepts, it\\'s fine to keep tutorials short and add footnotes for the advanced stuff. This allows the beginner to focus on the basics, and they can access the footnotes when they\\'re ready, making that content more effective. After all, isn\\'t being efficient key to programming? I used to hate being forced to take English classes as a CS student, but now I see why. I spent 4 hours debugging a Terminal issue, just to learn that it was because the tutorial told the user to paste the following command into the terminal: *eval \"$(ssh-agent exec -s)\"* Meaning, including the quotation marks. After 4 hours of research into chmod, File Links, Groups, root directories, Inodes, things I knew nothing about, I fixed the problem by removing the quotation marks. A know-it-all dev might say, \\'That\\'s obvious\\', but no! The instructions said \\'paste\\', which means: - Select code - ctrl+c on Windows (cmd+c on Mac) - ctrl+v/cmd+v in Terminal. Either the tutorial should\\'ve been: *eval $(ssh-agent exec -s)* , or the writer should have clarified the removal of quotes.

This mean any other state gets fucked up, people can reroute power to them. But Texas did not want to buy power from other people so they made it illegal to import power and to standardize the grid to be the same. So no its not the people running Texas power plants who are at fault. Its fucking Ted and the other politicians who made it illegal to be helped in times of crisis because of their greed.

Assuming releases to main originate from develop, the code quality in develop should be release-ready. Should the QA team test against feature branches, and upon successful testing, authorize the merge to develop? How atomic should these be? Should a complete story or bug fix be entirely within a feature branch before merging? Are feature branches created from main or develop? How often should main be merged into develop, or should develop be scrapped and recreated from main?

But some values depends on network call so if we update a value it might get update immediately via a network call.\\r\\n5. So we will have to update it again. To avoid this overhead we can drop the updation calls for the immediate value update.\\r\\n6. The current algo used by the React is called the React Fibre algo.\\r\\n7. The algo react uses to differentiate the web browser's tree and React's tree formed through create root is called reconciliation.\\r\\n8.

They are not. A lot of the things that women talk about among themselves are centered around their kids and family. Even ambitious, job centered women (especially them) are naturally going to get trapped into conversation re children because ultimately, the hardest job is being a parent. Most times when you have girl chat, it is to discuss the challenges that you face when you have to take off the working hat and put on the parent hat. This, in my opinion, is actually normal. When you leave your Office (for eg) and go home, the weirdness that is the personality of your child or children is a constant learning curve and as parents we want to ensure that we take care of them in the best way possible so we (girlfriends) talk about it hoping that we can bounce some ideas on how to do things. It helps, when you realize that your kid(s) is really not strange, just quirky and different and you should celebrate that.  If Meghan feels strange about this discussion, and she is Open about her fertility issues, she should be discussing that on the View then. I am only saying this because it is said that she is open about the challenge. I would not give this advice to anyone who does not want to talk about this.  But this is where girlfriends are important for women. Not withstanding the challenge that women talk too much and might reveal your secret, the fact that they will listen and allow you to get your concerns off your chest might put you in a better place to deal with your challenges. Sometimes, you just need someone ( not necessarily a psychiatrist) to listen and there is nothing in this world that beats a psychiatrist than your trusted girlfriend.\\nSo this brings me to the fact that I just think that Meghan McCain is too self centered. She is going to take someone talking about their kids and their experiences and feel that this is directed at her and bringing her to her own insecurities.

Those advocating for trying these approaches yet again bear a heavy burden of explaining why this time would be different. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMany outcomes that may sound plausible to those uninformed about Putin’s history quite rightly look disastrous to Ukrainians. For example, Putin has said he wants a neutral, “demilitarized” Ukraine. Russia had that beginning in 1994, when Ukraine surrendered the nuclear weapons it inherited from the Soviet Union in exchange for guarantees of its existing boundaries from Russia, the United States, and the United Kingdom. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nRather than allow this neutral, demilitarized Ukraine to live in peace within the longstanding boundaries Russia pledged to guarantee, Putin exploited Ukraine’s weakness to intervene in its politics and fix a presidential election for his deeply corrupt crony. When the Ukrainian people overthrew Putin’s puppet, Putin again took advantage of Ukraine’s weakness by seizing Crimea and a large part of Ukraine’s industrial heartland in the East. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAt some point, outsiders may tell the Ukrainians that they should accept a ceasefire at any price, even if it leaves Russian forces in their country. Ukraine did this after Russian’s 2008 invasion, with the promise of peace talks. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nRussia responded by stalling, shelling unoccupied parts of Ukraine, setting up two corrupt puppet regimes in its occupied territories — one of which shot down a Malaysian civilian airplane — and ultimately disavowing its agreement, to invade yet again. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNor are these isolated intrusions. Throughout the region, Russia has repeatedly seized parts of its neighbors’ territory, agreed to a ceasefire, and then continued its occupation without serious negotiations. It has occupied two regions of Georgia and one in Moldova for decades. Ukrainians know these “frozen conflicts” mean an indefinite loss of sovereignty, the indefinite subjugation of Ukrainians to Russian misrule, and a constant source of instability draining the country’s human and financial resources.', \"hey dan, I don't quite understand how the map function works , can you explain it a bit plz\", 'IShowSpeed, I’m a big fan', 'Bro is not 456 💀🙏 8:43', 'Criminals are always victims in their minds....they feel sorry for themselves after hurting others blaming the other for making them do it.

Disclosure, I am a 65, soon to be 66-year-old polio survivor. I began walking around 4 years old and have no use of my left arm. I was blessed to be able to get around and function in life. I still function but require an electric scooter to get around with a power seat lift in order to stand up. I also did get a handicap license plate as I hit my fifties because of a true need in order to avoid long distances as my legs began weakening further. When I was 19 years old back in 1975, I had completed a technical Programming degree at Control Data Institute. I applied at several places and had a very positive interview with a hospital records processing center in DeKalb County outside of Atlanta. The manager I interviewed with basically told me I had the position but he had to okay it with the Hospital. I followed up with my interviewer via phone, everything was good and I was excited about the opportunity. I followed up again and the tone had changed. He was very apologetic but the Hospital had told him that they needed to hire a black person and a black lady I went to school with fit the requirement along with checking another box, being female. I ended up finding a job as a Computer Operator at a Bank in Atlanta which delayed my entry into the Programming field for 3.5 years. I wasn't happy, however I refused to use my disabilities as a way to obtain the position because I felt it was wrong. I've never used it for advantage over another person. I believe that after my experience over 46 years ago, it is time to end affirmative action, enough Americans have been discriminated against and suffered for what they had nothing to do with using this racially discriminatory law. It is no more justifiable than if I had used my disability to wrest the Programming position from my former classmate or anyone. It would have made me no better than those who take positions from others based on race as opposed to merit. These types of advantages imposed against others are also an anchor around the neck of America as a whole. I watched our nation excel to the Moon and leave other nations in the dust.

I am convinced that the book \"Polyglot Notes\" should be in the bag of every business person, school and college student, and tourist. The most important thing is that the book gives a good motivation. Don\\'t be afraid to do something to realise your dreams!

The BQ is a federal party, but runs no one outside the province, and cares nothing about the ROC or the vast, English-speaking majority in Canada. Most of the Anglos have been driven out, with Quebec French now mandatory for businesses and government. The PQ has always been Separatist, waxing and waning with the political Moon phases, but now with the Liberals headed for total annihilation, I expect they'll start beating those drums more fiercely.

And even today it is more dangerous, because they can do it perfectly with the information from the internet and with a simple follow-up of your activity in their online casinos. I have not fallen into addiction, luckily, but I have relatives who have, and it is very sad. I plan not to gamble again, but sometimes I go back just for fun, I have never used all my capital or my monthly earnings, but I have used small amounts that added up to important parts of my capital.\\r\\n\\r\\nI will give some advice: always look at your percentages used, not just the numbers, percentage of your capital that has resulted in profits, or losses. And another thing, if you win, withdraw immediately, especially if it is an online casino. Anyway, as many people say; the best way to win is not to play, remember that casinos are literally traps, otherwise, they would not exist. But if you do not see yourself capable of quitting, start reducing your risks, use the money on what you later regretted not using, when you can use it. Give gifts to your loved ones, or learn to invest in stocks and in the market. And set a loss limit, never break it (I know you will) but try as hard as possible not to do so, be loyal to yourself.

Global warming was officially stated at 1.1°C in 1991 and 1.06°C in 2022.  There is no mechanism that would allow greenhouse gas behavior to cause global warming.   The back of the United Nation's IPCC science report states it took its greenhouse gas samples at 20,000 meters altitude where it is common high school level knowledge there is no greenhouse radiant energy.  This is typical practice for deceptive marketing to state legal data transparency protecting the perpetrators from fraud prosecution.  \\n\\nEarth's greenhouse effect is frequently used as a primary example to high school students of a system always in saturation from the strong greenhouse gas water vapor absorbing all the greenhouse radiant energy from the earth with greenhouse gases within 20 meters of the surface that is all around us everyday and can't have its overall effect changed.  There is no further greenhouse radiant energy to interact with greenhouse gases.  At 1% average tropospheric water vapor over 99% of earth’s greenhouse effect is from water vapor.  Water vapor would hold earth's greenhouse effect in saturation if it were the only greenhouse gas in the atmosphere.\\n\\nArctic warming is taking place with the proving mechanism being warm Atlantic Ocean waters migrating deeper and more frequently into the Arctic Ocean warming it and the region.   That warmer water is causing a few weeks less of reflective snow and ice coverage resulting in more solar heat gain to the Arctic region surface.\\n\\nAtmospheric CO2 levels of 1200 ppm about three times what they are today would greatly invigorate C3 plants the majority of plant life on earth greatly greening the planet. \\n\\n0.4% of the atmosphere is CO2 and on average 1% is H20 water vapor.   (1% H20)/(0.4% CO2) = 25.  Water vapor is 25 times more present in the atmosphere on average than CO2.   Water vapor has an CO2e of 18,  18 X 25 = 450 CO2e total for water vapor to 1 CO2e for CO2. \\n\\nThe Earth’s oceans have 3-1/2 million sea floor volcanic vents warming the water and changing it’s chemistry that have not been systematically accounted for.\", \"at 49:20 chat's meme finally paid off, and I never saw a more glorious reaction than everyone realizing where they were\", '😎Hey, thanks for watching!

And it's like that with everything it touches. They create this illusion that healthcare somehow naturally an intrinsic 'right' and that it has always been this way but then along came capitalism (whatever that is, like maybe being allowed to keep what God provides, but that's a whole other subject) and suddenly it destroyed everything. But if you actually look at all of human history, healthcare has always been a service provided very personally and intimately by one person to another person, and always for a cost set by the provider! So let's just start there. Yes, in the history of Christianity the idea of providing medical care for free was highly revered, but it was VOLUNTARY, moreover, those few who were known for seriously practicing this were CANONIZED as saints(!!), not forced to do any such thing. The problem is many americans have not experienced the relative unpleasantness of healthcare in other countries compared to what we have. The brutal bedside manners (or lack thereof) of doctors, the complete disregard for human dignity, privacy, etc. These things are BUILT INTO those systems, and actually many of those countries' citizens think it's pretty normal and they may even be ok with it, but I would seriously caution americans to not assume that what they don't know about is actually what they want. If you're not someone who likes the idea of going to a hospital and being treated like a piece of meat or a herd of cows, just be cautious of their 'pretty' socialist ideas, is all i say.\", 'This Story really puts this Fire Storm into Perspective.

It seems you likely struggled in the first two coding rounds. Also, in my experience, a rejection notice wouldn\\'t take three weeks unless you were a strong contender. Two general points: The biggest issue arises when an over-prepared applicant (the \"competitive coder\" type) receives a straightforward question they recognize and immediately dives in without much communication. Whether they go down the wrong path or not is secondary. What matters most is seeing how a candidate tackles an unfamiliar problem; it\\'s not just about reaching the solution. Remember: The interviewer already knows the answer; they\\'re interested in your approach. Bonus: If you recognize an interview question (from practice, etc.), tell the interviewer immediately. Solving it instantly wastes their time, forcing them to ask another question with less time. Pretending you don\\'t know it won\\'t work; programmers are bad actors, and they\\'ll be even more frustrated. Most interviewers have backup questions prepared. As for the nodding and letting you make mistakes, that\\'s normal for a good interviewer. Interviewing is like walking a dog; you let them explore a bit, reeling them in when needed, but not holding them too tightly. Often, candidates explain their intended solution, and you know it\\'s wrong, but you let them proceed (unless they\\'ve misunderstood the problem) to see what happens. Interviewers find this hard because they must suppress their helpful instincts, which they use daily at work. Nods, smiles, and remarks like \"mmh, interesting\" or \"okay\" aren\\'t positive or negative signals; they\\'re just polite gestures. Don\\'t get overconfident; realize you\\'re on your own at that moment. The same applies to general conversation; the interviewer might ask probing questions but generally won\\'t add anything new, only helping you think or bounce ideas, like playing tennis with a wall. It\\'s mostly about letting you succeed or fail independently. Remember: The interviewer isn\\'t trying to help; they\\'re trying NOT to help. Corollary: If the interviewer gives a helpful tip, you\\'re likely behind schedule. A good interviewer will subtly insert the tip during conversation. But if they interrupt you entirely to give an obvious tip, you\\'re far off track and struggling with communication, as it\\'s probably not their first attempt to guide you.', \"@ 28:12 in pseudo code for depth first search, i think, it's neighbors= g[at] instead of neighbors= graph[at]\", 'We want hindi dub ❤🎉', 'That was funny!

Simply stating 'think harder' doesn't offer useful guidance for preparation. As you mentioned initially, knowing how the failures contributed to future success would be helpful. For instance, did you increase your focus on algorithms? Did you refine your list of algorithms to memorize? Or did you concentrate more on big-O efficiency? The extra detail like 'Google just wants reasonable people' wasn't very helpful, given that you were presumably already reasonable in the first interview. On a positive note, you did mention that misinterpreting code is a critical error to avoid, which is an absolutely important point and it is very likely that coding interviewers will be specifically looking out for these kinds of misinterpretations of the problem.\", 'Thank you so much harry sir', 'That is why, I doubt Trump will ever agree to debate anyone on stage.', '-Snacksimus Prime • The Crimson Coward • Tactical Sloth • The Michelin Marksman • Camouflage Casserole • The Stationary Slaughterhouse • Red Ragnarok, Though Slower • Barrel-Chested, but Not With a Gun • The Bunker Bystander • Snack Norris • Paint Sponge Supreme • Weight Watcher Assassin • Cardio-Free Commando • Rolling Thunder, Minus the Rolling • The BBQ Ballistics Expert • The Snaccidental Shooter • Operation Dumbo Drop • Dead Weight Deadshot • Chubbs Rambo • Blubber Commando • The Tactical Tater Tot • Silent but Deadly (from the Snacks) • The Heavyset Hider • Friendly Fire Feaster • Big Red, Target Locked • Lieutenant Lard • Captain Chunk', 'Netenyahu masterminded the October 7, Pres Biden 😫😩👎👎', 'DOUBT!\\nat 6:27:49 why the setter function setSecret() is accepting a reference variable?

Thank you for this tutorial, and thank you Gwen for taking the time to create it! Edit: After watching the tutorial again, I have a couple of suggestions: 1. When making tutorials, you need to really understand the importance of adjusting your pace to that of the learner. You start with a great overview of key terms, then quickly introduce both advanced and beginner ideas together, which just confuses the viewer. Slow down, explain things simply, that\\'s what we need. 2. On the topic of mixing concepts, it\\'s fine to keep tutorials short and add footnotes for the advanced stuff. This allows the beginner to focus on the basics, and they can access the footnotes when they\\'re ready, making that content more effective. After all, isn\\'t being efficient key to programming? I used to hate being forced to take English classes as a CS student, but now I see why. I spent 4 hours debugging a Terminal issue, just to learn that it was because the tutorial told the user to paste the following command into the terminal: *eval \"$(ssh-agent exec -s)\"* Meaning, including the quotation marks. After 4 hours of research into chmod, File Links, Groups, root directories, Inodes, things I knew nothing about, I fixed the problem by removing the quotation marks. A know-it-all dev might say, \\'That\\'s obvious\\', but no! The instructions said \\'paste\\', which means: - Select code - ctrl+c on Windows (cmd+c on Mac) - ctrl+v/cmd+v in Terminal. Either the tutorial should\\'ve been: *eval $(ssh-agent exec -s)* , or the writer should have clarified the removal of quotes. As software development becomes more collaborative, engineers can\\'t get away with being asocial or bad communicators, so this is something that many need to improve on.', 'how does he clear the entire codes on the screen?

But Texas did not want to buy power from other people so they made it illegal to import power and to standardize the grid to be the same. So no its not the people running Texas power plants who are at fault. Its fucking Ted and the other politicians who made it illegal to be helped in times of crisis because of their greed.

Should the QA team test against feature branches, and upon successful testing, authorize the merge to develop? How atomic should these be? Should a complete story or bug fix be entirely within a feature branch before merging? Are feature branches created from main or develop?

They are not. A lot of the things that women talk about among themselves are centered around their kids and family. Even ambitious, job centered women (especially them) are naturally going to get trapped into conversation re children because ultimately, the hardest job is being a parent. Most times when you have girl chat, it is to discuss the challenges that you face when you have to take off the working hat and put on the parent hat. This, in my opinion, is actually normal. When you leave your Office (for eg) and go home, the weirdness that is the personality of your child or children is a constant learning curve and as parents we want to ensure that we take care of them in the best way possible so we (girlfriends) talk about it hoping that we can bounce some ideas on how to do things. It helps, when you realize that your kid(s) is really not strange, just quirky and different and you should celebrate that.  If Meghan feels strange about this discussion, and she is Open about her fertility issues, she should be discussing that on the View then. I am only saying this because it is said that she is open about the challenge. I would not give this advice to anyone who does not want to talk about this.  But this is where girlfriends are important for women. Not withstanding the challenge that women talk too much and might reveal your secret, the fact that they will listen and allow you to get your concerns off your chest might put you in a better place to deal with your challenges. Sometimes, you just need someone ( not necessarily a psychiatrist) to listen and there is nothing in this world that beats a psychiatrist than your trusted girlfriend.\\nSo this brings me to the fact that I just think that Meghan McCain is too self centered. She is going to take someone talking about their kids and their experiences and feel that this is directed at her and bringing her to her own insecurities.

Those advocating for trying these approaches yet again bear a heavy burden of explaining why this time would be different. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMany outcomes that may sound plausible to those uninformed about Putin’s history quite rightly look disastrous to Ukrainians. For example, Putin has said he wants a neutral, “demilitarized” Ukraine. Russia had that beginning in 1994, when Ukraine surrendered the nuclear weapons it inherited from the Soviet Union in exchange for guarantees of its existing boundaries from Russia, the United States, and the United Kingdom. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nRather than allow this neutral, demilitarized Ukraine to live in peace within the longstanding boundaries Russia pledged to guarantee, Putin exploited Ukraine’s weakness to intervene in its politics and fix a presidential election for his deeply corrupt crony. When the Ukrainian people overthrew Putin’s puppet, Putin again took advantage of Ukraine’s weakness by seizing Crimea and a large part of Ukraine’s industrial heartland in the East. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAt some point, outsiders may tell the Ukrainians that they should accept a ceasefire at any price, even if it leaves Russian forces in their country. Ukraine did this after Russian’s 2008 invasion, with the promise of peace talks. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nRussia responded by stalling, shelling unoccupied parts of Ukraine, setting up two corrupt puppet regimes in its occupied territories — one of which shot down a Malaysian civilian airplane — and ultimately disavowing its agreement, to invade yet again. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNor are these isolated intrusions. Throughout the region, Russia has repeatedly seized parts of its neighbors’ territory, agreed to a ceasefire, and then continued its occupation without serious negotiations. It has occupied two regions of Georgia and one in Moldova for decades. Ukrainians know these “frozen conflicts” mean an indefinite loss of sovereignty, the indefinite subjugation of Ukrainians to Russian misrule, and a constant source of instability draining the country’s human and financial resources.', \"hey dan, I don't quite understand how the map function works , can you explain it a bit plz\", 'IShowSpeed, I’m a big fan', 'Bro is not 456 💀🙏 8:43', 'Criminals are always victims in their minds....they feel sorry for themselves after hurting others blaming the other for making them do it.
